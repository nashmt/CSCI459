# Choice of Content Management System

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

A  simple example of Docker containers is needed that will show:

1. Basic container operations
2. Use of multiple containers
3. Linking of Apache and MySQL containers

# Decision:

The Apache server is a well known and commonly used with php and mysql. This is the server that
we have the most experience with. There are many tutorials and docker containers that have been
made using an Apache server. 


# Consequences: 

Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational. Docker containers are easy to send to another user 
and they can easily operate the container.
