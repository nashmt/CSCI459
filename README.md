# Application Use and Function

The point of this is to explain what the application will do. 

## Function

The application will be a database that agents in the real estate business can use to
list houses. They will have the ability to add new houses with primary key ID's. The agents can also
edit houses if there is a price change or other changes. The application will support a full set
of CRUD operations. You will be able to sort through the different housing options based off of
multiple variables including price or size.
